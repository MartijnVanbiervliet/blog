Hi,

I'm Martijn. I have a passion for all things related to software engineering, with Python as my specialty. You might find me hanging out at Python conferences and meetups in Belgium and surrounding areas.

##  Work and education
I obtained a Master's degree in Informatics at KU Leuven in 2019, and a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence in 2020. After graduating, I joined Dedalus Healthcare, which provides IT and software solutions for the healthcare industry in Europe. In my role as a machine learning engineer, I'm closely involved with the development of machine learning solutions for the healthcare industry, including clinical risk prediction and NLP.

Here's some small achievements:
* Building and coordinating development of a machine learning toolkit for clinical risk prediction that can be used to build and serve risk prediction models for different products. The toolkit is developed in Python and relies heavily on Pandas, Numpy and TensorFlow. The modules in the toolkit are used by data scientists during R&D to build and experiment with different ML models, as well as for deploying production-ready pipelines to automate ML model training at the customer site using their local patient data. Thanks to this toolkit, the team iterates faster on machine learning experiments, and ML pipelines can run reliably at over 30 customer hospitals.
* Shaping our clinical risk prediction models by experimenting with different configurations and staying updated with state-of-the-art research.
* Assisting the team by creating documentation and guidelines for building Python modules. To achieve this I introduced the use of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) on GitHub pages to serve internal documentation, and the use of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage Python dependencies and virtual environments. These efforts help onboard new team members and enable them to quickly set up their development environment.
* Enabling data scientists to be more productive, by leveraging cloud infrastructure and containerization. Data scientists can focus on their core tasks, while infrastructure and configuration is provided for them.
* Setting up AWS infrastructure for automating the training of ML models using the AWS CDK, and for providing a custom Generative AI pipeline using Lambda and Bedrock.

## Resources
Here's some of my favorite books, articles and videos:
* **A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout**: This book explains some of the most important concepts for creating complex software systems in a refreshing way. It doesn't linger on details, but goes straight into what really matters when building software modules that users love to use and other developers can understand.
* [**A design methodology for reliable software systems by B.H. Liskov**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1479992.1480018): A paper on developing complex software systems from 1972 that is still very relevant today. Liskov explains how to ensure software systems are reliable, starting from its design. He introduces the concepts of "structured programming" and defines a methodology for achieving good modularity.
* **LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM))**: Larry McEnerney, Director of the University of Chicago's Writing Program, tutors a session with helpful rules on how to write effectively, emphasizing how to provide value to your audience.
