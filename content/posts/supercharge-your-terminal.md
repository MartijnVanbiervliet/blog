As a software engineer, I spend a lot of time using the terminal. The terminal can be an incredibly powerful and effective tool in your everyday workflow. Every action you take is directly at your fingertips - the keys on your keyboard. Learning to use a command-line interface effectively not only boosts your productivity but also makes the experience more enjoyable.

Brandon Rhodes expresses it well in this [talk](https://youtu.be/I56oFTm9UlE?si=9gMgSN2pq7l2tNmF). Every once in a while, itâ€™s a good idea to stop and sharpen your tools. It's no use mowing a large field of grass with a blunt scythe. Learning how your tools work is essential if you use them day in and day out. You can tailor the configuration to your specific preferences and requirements to get the best out of it.

In this guide, I'll share my favorite tools and configurations for setting up a new Linux/Unix terminal environment. You can use it as a source of inspiration to set up your own terminal. Here's some other sources that inspired me on this topic: [mischavandenburg](https://github.com/mischavandenburg/dotfiles/tree/main), [bartekspitza](https://youtu.be/mSXOYhfDFYo?si=XOWWMjgAvOWjGMcx), [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen), [omerxx](https://github.com/omerxx/dotfiles/tree/master), [Tech Craft](https://youtu.be/2OHrTQVlRMg?si=4VUN2J4W92AExoNT).

Here's an example of what my terminal looks like with Zsh, Powerlevel10k, tmux and NeoVim:

![Terminal screenshot](/images/terminal-setup.jpg)

# Basic setup
The following instructions assume you're using a Linux distribution with the `apt` package manager, such as Ubuntu or Debian. If you're using a different distribution with another package manager (like `pacman` for Arch Linux or `dnf` for Fedora), simply substitute `apt` with your system's package manager in the commands below.

Install and upgrade basic packages
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --upgrade install \
	zip unzip sed curl wget git htop ncdu tree
```

Install the [Brew package manager](https://brew.sh/) to get access to tools that are not available on `apt`.
After installing Brew, run the suggested command to add it to your PATH.
```bash
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /home/martijn/.bashrc  
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
Install the additional packages:
```bash
apt-get install build-essential
```
```bash
brew install gcc
```

# Shell theme
Customizing the look and feel of your terminal gives it that personal touch, making it more enjoyable to use. There are several options to customize your shell theme, which will be listed below. First, choose your shell technology: Bash, Zsh, or Fish are the most popular options. I recommend Bash or Zsh because they are supported by most tools we'll be installing.

###  Zsh with Powerlevel10K theme (optional)

Use Oh My Zsh to manage the Zsh configuration.
First, [install Zsh using apt or brew](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki).
```bash
brew install zsh
```
Now [install Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki).
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
Install a [nerd font for the terminal](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#fonts) to support more icons.

Install the [Powerlevel10k theme for Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#manual).

### Oh My Bash
Consider skipping Zsh and modifying Bash instead with [Oh My Bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash)

### Starship (Bash, Zsh, Fish and others)
[Starship](https://starship.rs/guide/) supports Bash, Zsh, Fish, and others.
```
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
```

# Dotfiles
In Unix, configuration is stored inside dotfiles and `.config` inside your home directory.
You can store them on a Git repository or any other place where you can access them easily.
I stored my dotfiles in a public Github repository, so I can clone them to any machine.

### Github CLI
Get the GitHub CLI to authorize with private Git repositories.

[Install using Brew](https://github.com/cli/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#homebrew)
```bash
brew install gh
```
Authorize with Github
```bash
gh auth login
```
### Get dotfiles
```bash
gh repo clone MartijnVanbiervliet/dotfiles
```

In my dotfiles repository, I've included an installer script that will symlink the dotfiles to my home directory. Using parameters to the installer script, you can choose to install only specific parts of the configuration. I recommend setting up your own repository for your personal dotfiles.
```bash
chmod +x ~/dotfiles/installer
~/dotfiles/installer
```

# Text editor
Modern code and text editors are ubiquitous. There are dozens to choose from. However, the old-school Vim - introduced in 1991 - still has a large following thanks to its simplicity and keyboard-first approach [^1].
[^1]: Although, a lot of developers are more familiar with the internet memes about closing Vim than the editor itself.

Vim encourages users to abandon their mouse and perform all actions with the keyboard. Although there's a steeper learning curve, the experience allows you to perform frequent actions faster and more satisfyingly. By not having to remove your hands from the keyboard and staying inside the terminal, there are fewer distractions to your work. Ever since I started learning Vim motions - the default keyboard strokes and combos in Vim - I have fully embraced them in writing and coding. There is a reason why most modern code editors support Vim motions out-of-the-box or with a plugin.

While Vim is powerful in its simplicity, it doesn't include many essential features found in contemporary code editors - like plugin support, integrated debugging, language servers, and modern graphical interfaces. This is where Neovim comes in - a modern fork of Vim that extends the editor with all these capabilities while maintaining Vim's core philosophy.

## Neovim
[Use Brew to install](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#homebrew-on-macos-or-linux)
```bash
brew install neovim
```

### LazyVim
LazyVim is a pre-configured Neovim configuration that is easy to use and customize. My personal Neovim configuration, based on LazyVim, is included in my dotfiles (as described in [dotfiles](#dotfiles)). But you can also install LazyVim from scratch.
[Install LazyVim](http://www.lazyvim.org/installation).

# Terminal multiplexer
A terminal multiplexer allows you to create multiple sessions in a single terminal window. A very popular terminal multiplexer is [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), but there are alternatives such as:
* [Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
* [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/)

## Tmux
Install tmux using apt.
```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```

Install the tmux plugin manager. Plugins allow you to add more functionality and configure a custom theme.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

To install plugins, start `tmux` and install plugins with `Ctrl+b I`

Here's some command to get you started:
* To use tmux resurrect, use `Ctrl+b + Ctrl+s` to save.
* Detach from tmux session: `Ctrl+b d`
* Attach to tmux session: `tmux a`

My tmux configuration is part of [my dotfiles](#dotfiles). It includes the following plugins:
* [tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) - Save and restore tmux sessions
* [tmux-continuum](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum) - Auto-save and restore tmux sessions
* [tmux-cpu](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-cpu) - Display CPU usage in tmux
* [catppuccin/tmux](https://github.com/catppuccin/tmux) - Catppuccin theme for tmux
* [christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) - Navigate between tmux and vim splits

# Optional

### WSLU (If using WSL)
If using Windows Subsystem For Linux, [install WSLU](https://wslutiliti.es/wslu/install.html#ubuntu) to get more tools.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wslutilities/wslu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wslu
```
Set BROWSER env to support opening host browser from WSL VM.
```bash
echo "export BROWSER=wslview" >> ~/.bashrc
```
This adds support to open your browser to authenticate with Github CLI.
[Reference](https://superuser.com/questions/1262977/open-browser-in-host-system-from-windows-subsystem-for-linux)

### LazyGit
[LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) is a terminal UI for Git commands.
```bash
brew install lazygit
```

### tldr-pages
[Install tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr?tab=readme-ov-file#how-do-i-use-it) 
tldr-pages is a super useful tool for getting a quick glance at how to use a command-line tool. Instead of digging through the man pages, tldr shows - at a glance - what the most prevalent way is to use that command. tldr-pages is a community-driven open-source project that can be used addition to traditional `man` pages.

### Pyenv
Manage multiple Python versions using `pyenv`. An essential tool for Python developers. It allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Python. This is a must-have if you're working on Python projects that are based on different versions.

[Install with Brew.](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#homebrew-in-macos)

[Set up the shell environment for Bash or Zsh.](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv)

### Fzf
[Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a command-line fuzzy finder that revolutionizes how you search through files, directories, command history, and more. By simply entering a part of the filename, you can quickly find the file you're looking for.

Some key features:
- Fuzzy search through files and directories
- Search through command history
- Integration with vim/neovim
- Customizable key bindings
- Preview window for files

Install with:
```bash
brew install fzf
```
