Here's some of my favorite books, articles and videos:
* **A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout**: This book explains some of the most important concepts for creating complex software systems in a refreshing way. It doesn't linger on details, but goes straight into what really matters when building software modules that users love to use and other developers can understand.
* [**A design methodology for reliable software systems by B.H. Liskov**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1479992.1480018): A paper on developing complex software systems from 1972 that is still very relevant today. Liskov explains how to ensure software systems are reliable, starting from its design. He introduces the concepts of "structured programming" and defines a methodology for achieving good modularity.
* **LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM))**: Larry McEnerney, Director of the University of Chicago's Writing Program, tutors a session with helpful rules on how to write effectively, emphasizing how to provide value to your audience.
