I am Martijn, a software engineer from Belgium, passionate about Python and machine learning.

Since 2020, I've worked at Dedalus Healthcare in Ghent, where our team builds AI solutions for the healthcare industry. Projects include clinical risk prediction, natural language processing, and generative AI applications. My area of expertise includes building machine learning pipelines, creating tools to help data scientists and engineers be more productive, managing ML Ops and observability, and setting up cloud infrastructure.

In 2019, I obtained a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven. During an internship at [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/), I completed a comparative study of neural network accelerators for edge applications. This opportunity introduced me to Python and taught me how to optimize neural networks for neural processing units and GPUs.

The year before, I finished my Master's in Informatics at KU Leuven, specializing in software engineering and distributed systems. For my Master's thesis "Energy-aware software deployment in the IoT", I researched optimizing energy consumption in edge computing networks. 

During my Bachelor's degree in Informatics, I focused on software development for web and mobile applications. During these studies, internships, and student work, I gained experience with JavaScript, C#, and web application frameworks.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking vacations, reading books, tinkering with home automation, and staying updated with the latest car and technology news. I also dabble in photography to capture the natural beauty I encounter during our vacations. Additionally, I play the guitar and enjoy wall climbing, although I don't get to do these as often as I'd like.

I like attending Python conferences and meetups in and around Belgium. Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests or want to discuss software engineering!
