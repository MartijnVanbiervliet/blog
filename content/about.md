I'm Martijn, a passionate software engineer who specializes in Python and machine learning. I often attend Python conferences and meetups in and around Belgium.

I hold a Master's degree in Informatics (2019) and a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (2020) from KU Leuven. Currently, I work at Dedalus Healthcare, where I work on machine learning solutions for the healthcare industry. My projects include clinical risk prediction and natural language processing (NLP) applications.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking vacations, reading books, and staying updated with the latest in car and technology news. I also dabble in photography with a Sony A6000 to capture beautiful scenery on vacation. Additionally, I play the guitar and enjoy wall climbing, although I don't get to do these as often as I'd like.

Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests or want to discuss software engineering!
