I am Martijn, a software engineer from Belgium, passionate about Python and machine learning.

Since 2020, I've worked at [Dedalus Healthcare](https://www.dedalus.com/global/en/) in Ghent, where our team builds AI solutions for the healthcare industry. Projects include clinical risk prediction, natural language processing, and generative AI. I build machine learning pipelines, create tools to help data scientists and engineers be more productive, manage ML Ops and observability, and set up cloud infrastructure.

In 2019, I obtained a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven. During an internship atÂ [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/), I did a comparative study of neural network accelerators for edge applications. This opportunity introduced me to Python and taught me how to optimize neural networks for neural processing units and GPUs.

Before, I obtained a Masterâ€™s in Informatics at KU Leuven, specializing in software engineering and distributed systems. For my Master's thesis, I researched optimizing energy consumption in edge computing networks. 

For my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Informatics, I specialized in software development for web and mobile applications. This is where I gained experience with JavaScript, C#, and web application frameworks.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking vacations, reading books, tinkering with home automation, and staying updated with the latest in car and technology news. I also dabble in photography with a Sony A6000 to capture beautiful scenery on vacation. Additionally, I play the guitar and enjoy wall climbing, although I don't get to do these as often as I'd like.

I like attending Python conferences and meetups in and around Belgium. Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests or want to discuss software engineering!
